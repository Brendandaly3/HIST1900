    -  The concept of hypertext, or linked text, is introduced as a means of navigating information in the Memex.
-  The Future of Information
    -  Bush predicts that the exponential growth of knowledge will lead to a need for better ways of organizing and accessing information.
    -  He argues that this will require a new type of machine, one that can help individuals think, reason, and understand complex information.
    -  The Memex serves as a prototype for this type of machine.
    -  Bush also foresees the possibility of using machines to enhance human intelligence and creativity.

-  Conclusion
    -  Bush concludes by saying that the future of information technology holds great promise, but it is up to society to determine how it will be used.
    -  He argues that the development of the Memex and other advanced information technologies should be guided by principles of responsibility, creativity, and a commitment to improving society.
